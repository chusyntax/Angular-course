What are Directives:

In Angular, Directives are defined as classes that can add new behavior to the elements in the template or modify existing behavior. The purpose of Directives in Angular is to maneuver the DOM, be it by adding new elements to DOM or removing elements and even changing the appearance of the DOM elements.

Arguments vs Paramters:

A parameter is a variable in a function definition. It is a placeholder and hence does not have a concrete value. An argument is a value passed during function invocation. In a way, arguments fill in the place the parameters have held for them.
